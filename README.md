Feeds SDK
==========

Feeds has been a fully **decentralized** social network since its inception, and it need be oriented as a universal decentralized social networking service, not be confined to be pure application. With more third-parties integrated Feeds SDKs, a Feeds ecosystem would be brewed and risen with more traffic together.

### An use-case

Imagine a scenario where users can `mint` #Phantz NFTs, `discuss` #Phantz topics on their dedicated Feeds channel, and `trade` #Phantz NFTs on the Pasar marketplace. All activities are available on the #Phantz website. As a result, users will feel sticky and royal with the Phantz collection.

*With Feeds SDKs, Phantz website can integrate basic `social graph` and `channel service` onto Phantz website. Therefore, Phantz website can have it’s owned channels to dedicated discuss around `Phantz collection` on its website.  And plus being with Pasar market integrated on website, users would be more roylaty and sticky to Phantz project or product***

### Components

`Feeds SDK` contains a package of libraries to be integrated into third-party applications, which would be made up of three layers:

- Profile NFT

- Social Graph

- Feeds channel



`Social Graph` is the core component of `Feeds SDK` and `Social Graph` consist of the relationship graph between users. There are three dimensions of soical graph content:

- Generic soical graph:  `following relationship`
- Social graph related to `channel`
- Creative VCs-based social graph

With `social graph`  `SDKs` , applications can design their own soical features like ***Youtube*** or ***Reddit,*** but they would integrate `social graph` data into their application to gain basic user base.

Apart from `social graph` , Feeds has it’s own format standard of social data consisted of `#channel` and `#post` data.
